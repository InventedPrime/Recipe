1. Head over to the [database_setup](./db_setup.md) to get started with setting up your database.

2. Install the necessary dependencies by running:

    ```bash
    composer install
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```

4. Start the frontend build process for CSS/JS in a seperate terminal:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

5. The terminal that is handling the server will provide you with a URL to access the application, typically `http://localhost:8000`. Open this URL in your web browser to start using the Recipe App.
